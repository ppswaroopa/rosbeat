# rosbeat
Connecting ROS logs to Elasticsearch

### Here's how to align with Filebeat-like extensibility:

---

### âœ… **What you already have:**

1. **Multi-log parsing support** (rosout, roslaunch, master, per-node).
2. **JSON structuring** of parsed logs.
3. **Bulk ingestion into Elasticsearch** with indexing.
4. **Basic CLI for usage automation.**

---

### ðŸ”„ **What you'll want to add for rosbeat scalability:**

#### 1. **Modular Collector Engine**

* Abstract `parse_*_log()` into modular plugin-like components.
* Auto-discover and classify new `.log` files (like youâ€™re doing).
* Support glob or pattern-matching rules to classify logs.

#### 2. **Incremental Harvesting**

* Track offsets or hashes to avoid re-parsing unchanged logs.
* Store state in a `.rosbeat_state.json` file, similar to Filebeat registry.

#### 3. **Config-driven Architecture**

* YAML/JSON config for:

  * File paths / include/exclude patterns
  * Index name mappings
  * Log level filters
  * Output (Elasticsearch, stdout, file, etc.)

#### 4. **Daemon Mode + Scheduler**

* Allow `rosbeat` to run as a background process.
* Periodically scan and ingest logs, optionally with `watchdog`.

#### 5. **Output Plugins**

* Add more than just Elasticsearch:

  * File output
  * Kafka topic
  * HTTP endpoint
  * stdout (for dev)

#### 6. **Health + Metrics Endpoint**

* Optional Flask/FastAPI service for:

  * Ingestion stats
  * Log processing metrics
  * Config reloading

#### 7. **CLI Tooling**

* Subcommands like:

  * `rosbeat parse`
  * `rosbeat ingest`
  * `rosbeat watch`
  * `rosbeat config test`

### ðŸš€ Final Goal:

Turn this into a pip-installable tool:

```bash
pip install rosbeat
rosbeat --help
```
